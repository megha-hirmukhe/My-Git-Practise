    <h2>Basic Things about react:</h2>
    <p>React is not a framework. It is just a library developed by Facebook to solve some problems that we were facing earlier. Learning any new framework or library is exciting but before that, we have to get the concept of that library or framework. To get the concept of React you need to know what basic things are used in React.
        
React is a front-end JavaScript library developed by Facebook in 2011.
It follows the component based approach which helps in building reusable UI components.
It is used for developing complex and interactive web and mobile UI.
Even though it was open-sourced only in 2015, it has one of the largest communities supporting it.
